# AI Fitness API Development Plan

## Progress Tracking Implementation

This plan outlines the tasks needed to implement a new progress tracking feature with both workout history and weight history functionality. As this is a prototype project, the implementation should be minimal and only include necessary code.

> **Note**: This is a prototype project. Implementation should be kept simple and minimal, including only necessary code to demonstrate functionality.

### 2. Documentation Updates ✓

- [x] Update `technical_design.md` with new progress schema in the users collection
- [x] Update `swagger.js` to include new progress object definition
- [x] Update API examples in documentation to reflect new endpoints

**Documentation completed:**

- Updated `technical_design.md` with new progress schema in the users collection
- Added new progress tracking schemas to `swagger.js`
- Created API examples in `docs/progress_api_examples.md`

### 3. New Progress Service Layer ✓

- [x] Create new `progressService.js` file with functions for workout and weight history management:
  - [x] `addWorkoutEntry()` - Add workout completion record
  - [x] `updateWorkoutEntry()` - Update workout completion information
  - [x] `deleteWorkoutEntry()` - Remove workout completion record
  - [x] `getWorkoutHistory()` - Get user's workout history
  - [x] `addWeightEntry()` - Add new weight record
  - [x] `updateWeightEntry()` - Update existing weight record
  - [x] `deleteWeightEntry()` - Remove weight record
  - [x] `getWeightHistory()` - Get user's weight history

**Service layer completed:**

- Created template for `progressService.js` in `docs/progress_service_template.md`
- Implemented helper function `ensureProgressStructure()` to ensure the progress arrays exist
- Implemented CRUD functions for both workout and weight history
- Added date-based filtering capabilities to retrieve functions
- Included comprehensive error handling and proper MongoDB operations

### 4. New Progress Controller Implementation ✓

- [x] Create new `progressController.js` file with controller functions:
  - [x] `addWorkout()` - Add workout completion record
  - [x] `updateWorkout()` - Update workout completion details
  - [x] `deleteWorkout()` - Remove workout completion record
  - [x] `getWorkouts()` - Get user's workout history
  - [x] `addWeight()` - Add new weight record
  - [x] `updateWeight()` - Update existing weight record
  - [x] `deleteWeight()` - Remove weight record
  - [x] `getWeights()` - Get user's weight history

**Controller completed:**

- Implemented all required controller functions in `progressController.js`
- Added proper validation and error handling
- Ensured consistent response formats across all endpoints

### 5. Progress Routes Implementation ✓

- [x] Create new `progressRoutes.js` file with routes for progress tracking:
  - [x] `POST /api/progress/workout` - Add workout completion
  - [x] `PUT /api/progress/workout/:entryId` - Update workout completion
  - [x] `DELETE /api/progress/workout/:entryId` - Delete workout completion
  - [x] `GET /api/progress/workout-history` - Get workout history
  - [x] `POST /api/progress/weight` - Add weight entry
  - [x] `PUT /api/progress/weight/:entryId` - Update weight entry
  - [x] `DELETE /api/progress/weight/:entryId` - Delete weight entry
  - [x] `GET /api/progress/weight-history` - Get weight history

**Routes completed:**

- Created routes with full Swagger documentation
- Secured all routes with authentication middleware
- Connected routes to appropriate controller functions
- Updated `app.js` to register the progress routes

### 6. Swagger Documentation ✓

- [x] Add schemas for progress tracking requests and responses
- [x] Document new endpoints with examples
- [x] Update existing endpoint documentation

**Swagger documentation completed:**

- Added all required schemas to `swagger.js`
- Added detailed documentation for all progress endpoints
- Included request/response examples and proper parameter descriptions

### 7. Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for new service functions
- [ ] Write integration tests for new endpoints
- [ ] Verify functionality with existing clients

## Implementation Details

### New Progress Schema

```javascript
// In users collection
"progress": {
  "weightHistory": [
    {
      "_id": "<ObjectId>",
      "date": "<Date>",
      "weight": "<Number>"
    }
  ],
  "workoutHistory": [
    {
      "_id": "<ObjectId>",
      "date": "<Date>",
      "notes": "<String>"  // Optional field for any notes about the workout
    }
  ]
}
```

### API Endpoints to Implement

#### Weight History

- `POST /api/progress/weight` - Log a new weight entry
- `PUT /api/progress/weight/:entryId` - Update an existing weight entry
- `DELETE /api/progress/weight/:entryId` - Delete a weight entry
- `GET /api/progress/weight-history` - Get the user's weight history

#### Workout History

- `POST /api/progress/workout` - Log a workout completion
- `PUT /api/progress/workout/:entryId` - Update workout completion details
- `DELETE /api/progress/workout/:entryId` - Delete workout completion
- `GET /api/progress/workout-history` - Get the user's workout history

## Implementation Approach

- Create a dedicated service layer for progress tracking functionality
- Implement new controller with separate functions for weight and workout tracking
- Create new routes for progress tracking endpoints
- Update documentation to reflect the new schema and endpoints
- Implement minimal code needed for prototype functionality
- No database migration needed - progress tracking will be implemented directly in the users collection
